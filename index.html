<h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>Welcome!</p>

    <p>Allow me to tell you a little bit about myself...</p>

    <p>I have spent the past 15 years working in the software industry as a Quality Assurance Engineer. 
        For many years I worked primarily on frontend testing, ensuring UI components and functionality met customer satisfaction.
        However, at my current position with Sendgrid, I am primarily focused on backend testing.  
        Here I verify endpoints are returning the expected results and the services are communicating with each other.
    </p>
